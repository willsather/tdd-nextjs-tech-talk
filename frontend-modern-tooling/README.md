# Hexagonal Architecture 🤝🏼 Turborepo

This example is composed of two Next.js applications, two ports (_commerce engine and payment processor_), and two adapters (_implementation of a commerce engine and implementation of a payment processor_)

## Getting Started

### Install the dependencies:

```zsh
$ pnpm install
```

### Compile the app:

```zsh
$ pnpm build
```

### Run the dev server:

```zsh
$ pnpm dev
```

The `app-one` and `app-two` will be available on ports 3001 & 3000, respectively.

### Test the app:

```zsh
$ pnpm test
```

### Additional tooling

This project also has some configured some tools like:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Applications

Located under `/apps`, you will find two applications.

- `app-one`: a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `app-two`: another simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app

## Domain Driven Design

In this example, there are two primary **Domains**:

1. Commerce
2. Payments

Located under `/packages`, you will find two **Domains** (`@repo/commerce` and `@repo/payments`) which handle the interactions between the applications and the integration implementations.

- `@repo/commerce`: encompasses interactions to a commerce engine used by both `app-one` and `app-two`
- `@repo/payments`: encompasses interactions to a payment processor used by both `app-one` and `app-two`

## Subdomains

Within each domain, there are many smaller, individual domains, called **Subdomains**. _Each_ **Domain** under `/packages` have service(s) that expose _each_ of the **Subdomains**:

> For example, within the Commerce Domain, there could be Subdomains such as Products, Customers, Carts, Orders, etc.

- `ProductService`: defines interactions between `app-one` & `app-two` _AND_ the implementation of `CustomProductService`
- `CheckoutService`: defines interactions between `app-one` & `app-two` _AND_ the implementation of `CustomCheckoutService`

### Dependency Inversion

The goal of the `/packages/commerce` and `/packages/payments` is to achieve a form of [Dependency Inversion](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/blog/write-more-maintainable-testable-code-with-dependency-injection/).

**The interfaces are called Ports (or policy modules) and contain the `subdomain` business logic.**

> For example, within the Products Subdomain, there could be business logic like `getProduct(id: string)` and `getProducts`.

By exposing an interface via the `@repo/commerce`, this allows the two applications to depend on the interface, while the implementation (ie: `ProductService` or `CheckoutService`) **ALSO** depend on the interface. This effectively achieves Dependency Inversion because **BOTH** applications **AND** the `CustomProductService` are dependent on the `ProductService` interface.

`app-one` -> `@repo/commerce` (`ProductService` <- `CustomProductService`)

This can also be applied to the `@repo/payments` domain as well:

`app-one` -> `@repo/payments` (`CheckoutService` <- `CustomCheckoutService`)

### Bounded Contexts

Furthermore, the organization and dependency inversion of `@repo/commerce` and `@repo/payments` creates a [Bounded Context](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html) (aka domain aggregates). This helps keep each Subdomain small and modular ('_the boundary will help the subdomain focus to do only 1 thing and do well_'). Taking the diagram above, you can draw this in like so:

### Benefits

Often with applications with a large amount of dependencies and integrations, the application becomes highly coupled to the implementation of the integration itself - in this case, the commerce engine and the payment processor.

However, dependency inversion allows for the decoupling of the applications and these integrations by defining the domain of which they relate; allowing for easier testing, greater flexibility, and cleaner design as in the future. Also, these things can make the change/swap of an integration much simpler - without the consuming application needing to know (or care).

## Implementations

Located under each`/packages/**` domain, you will find an '_implementation(s)_' which handle the specific implementation details of each integration.

**These implementations are called adapters.**

An adapter will be dependent on the interface (policy module) provided by the respective port.

## Shared Configuration

Located under `/packages/config` is all the shared configuration which the Turborepo uses. This is a great space to put handy developer tools and code cleanliness configuration.

- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `@repo/vitest-config`: `vitest` configurations for `browser` and `node` configurations
